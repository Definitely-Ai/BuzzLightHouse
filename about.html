                        <h2>The Beginning of a Dream</h2>
                        <p>Our story began in the mid-1970s when Henry “Buzz” Dugan and his wife Judy, avid travelers from the Jersey Shore, discovered the tranquil beauty of Naples and Vanderbilt Beach. Captivated by the area's charm, they found a perfect piece of waterfront property in 1978. This location became the foundation of their dream: a family-oriented restaurant that would embody the essence of old Florida, offering breathtaking views and a warm, inviting atmosphere.</p>

                        <h2>Opening Our Doors to Naples</h2>
                        <p>In March 1980, Buzz's Lighthouse Restaurant officially opened its doors. It quickly became a beloved local spot, celebrated for its fresh seafood and hearty sandwiches. Buzz and Judy had a vision of creating a place where families could gather, enjoy warm weather, sip on ice-cold beer, and savor food that was always fresh from the Gulf. Their unwavering commitment to quality, family, and hospitality has been the cornerstone of our success for over four decades.</p>

                        <h2>A Naples Classic Through the Years</h2>
                        <p>Buzz's Lighthouse has stood the test of time, remaining a cherished Naples classic loved by both locals and visitors alike. Despite the rapid changes in the surrounding area and challenges like Hurricane Ian—which caused significant damage shortly after a major kitchen renovation—our commitment to excellent food and heartfelt service has never wavered. The restaurant continues to thrive as a family-run business.</p>

                        <h2>A Celebration of Tradition and Family</h2>
                        <p>At Buzz's Lighthouse, every meal is more than just food—it's a celebration of our rich history, deep-rooted family values, and the vibrant culinary traditions of Naples. We invite you to join us, share in our story, and create lasting memories with your loved ones.</p>

                        <h2>Welcome to the Family</h2>
                        <p>We look forward to welcoming you into our family at Buzz's Lighthouse Restaurant, where the legacy of Buzz Dugan continues to shine brightly on the beautiful shores of Naples.</p>
